        In West Philadelphia born and raised
        On the playground is where I spent most of my days
        Chillin' out, maxin', relaxin' all cool
        And all shootin' some b-ball outside of the school
        When a couple of guys who were up to no good
        Started makin' trouble in my neighborhood
        I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
        And said "You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air"
        I begged and pleaded with her day after day
        But she packed my suitcase and sent me on my way
        She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket
        I put my Walkman on and said "I might as well kick it"
        First class, yo, this is bad
        Drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass
        Is this what the people of Bel-Air living like?
        Hmm, this might be all right
        But wait, I hear they're prissy, bourgeois, and all that
        Is this the type of place that they should send this cool cat?
        I don't think so, I'll see when I get there
        I hope they're prepared for the Prince of Bel-Air
